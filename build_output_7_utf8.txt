Specified module format 
(EcmaScript Modules) is 
not matching the module 
format of the source code 
(CommonJs)
The EcmaScript module 
format was specified in 
the package.json that is 
affecting this source 
file or by using an 
special extension, but it 
looks like that CommonJs 
syntax is used in the 
source code.
Exports made by CommonJs 
syntax will lead to a 
runtime error, since the 
module is in EcmaScript 
mode. Either change the 
"type" field in the 
package.json or replace 
CommonJs syntax with 
EcmaScript import/export 
syntax in the source file.
