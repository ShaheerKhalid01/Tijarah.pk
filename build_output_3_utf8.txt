.config.js
Specified module 
format (EcmaScript 
Modules) is not 
matching the module 
format of the source 
code (CommonJs)
The EcmaScript 
module format was 
specified in the 
package.json that is 
affecting this 
source file or by 
using an special 
extension, but it 
looks like that 
CommonJs syntax is 
used in the source 
code.
Exports made by 
CommonJs syntax will 
lead to a runtime 
error, since the 
module is in 
EcmaScript mode. 
Either change the 
"type" field in the 
package.json or 
replace CommonJs 
syntax with 
EcmaScript 
import/export syntax 
in the source file.
